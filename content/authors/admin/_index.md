He currently practices both Dermatology and Medical Oncology in the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, where he co-directs multidiscliplinary clinics in advanced skin cancer, including the [Merkel Cell Carcinoma Treatment Program](https://www.massgeneral.org/cancer-center/treatments-and-services/melanoma/merkel-cell-carcinoma).  

Dr. Miller belongs to several professional organizations, including the American Academy of Dermatology, Medical Dermatology Society, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology.  He has numerous peer-reviewed publications and he has presented his work at the Society for Investigative Dermatology, New York Academy of Medicine, the American Academy of Dermatology, and the U.S. FDA.  He is also a reviewer for the British Journal of Dermatology, Journal of Investigative Dermatology, JAEDV, and Clinical Cancer Research.

Due to his expertise in Merkel Cell Carcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Dr. Miller has also served on advisory boards to several pharmaceutical companies, inlcuding Pfizer, Merck, Regeneron and Sanofi Genzyme.

The Miller Lab's research portfolio consists of clinical and translational projects in [**Merkel Cell carcinoma**](https://www.merkelcellcarcinoma.io), cutaneous [**Squamous Cell Carcinoma**](https://www.squamouscellcarcinoma.io) and Melanoma.  Dr. Miller has received support for his research from the NIH in the form of a loan repayment award, a Research Grant from the American Skin Association, the Paul Carbone, MD fellowship award from ECOG-ACRIN, and the Mentoring Award in Oncology, Advanced Analytics and Regulatory Science from Project Data Sphere.
