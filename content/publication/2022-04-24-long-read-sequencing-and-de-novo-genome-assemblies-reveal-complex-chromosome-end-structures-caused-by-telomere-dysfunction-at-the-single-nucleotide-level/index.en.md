abstract: Karyotype change and subsequent evolution is triggered by chromosome fusion and rearrangement events, which often occur when telomeres become dysfunctional. Telomeres protect linear chromosome ends from DNA damage responses (DDRs), and telomere dysfunction may result in genome instability. However, the complex chromosome end structures and the other possible consequences of telomere dysfunction have rarely been resolved at the nucleotide level due to the lack of the high-throughput methods needed to analyse these highly repetitive regions. Here we applied long-read sequencing technology to Caenorhabditis elegans survivor lines that emerged after telomere dysfunction. The survivors have preserved traces of DDRs in their genomes and our data revealed that variants generated by telomere dysfunction are accumulated along all chromosomes. The reconstruction of the chromosome end structures through de novo genome assemblies revealed diverse types of telomere damage processing at the nucleotide level. When telomeric repeats were totally eroded by telomere dysfunction, DDRs were mostly terminated by chromosome fusion events. We also partially reconstructed the most complex end structure and its DDR signatures, which would have been accumulated via multiple cell divisions. These finely resolved chromosome end structures suggest possible mechanisms regarding the repair processes after telomere dysfunction, providing insights into chromosome evolution in nature.
